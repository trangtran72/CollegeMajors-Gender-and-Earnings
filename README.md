## CollegeMajors-Gender-and-Earnings

This repository contains information on the analysis about the effect of women's representation and college majors, on the average median incomes

This project was an extension to the project done by *FiveThirtyEight*. 

The link to their repository can be found below

The result of their project was published as an article *The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major* on their website in 2014. 

The link to the article can be found below:

In this project, I will be using the cleaned dataset from Five Thirty Eight. However, instead of producing visualizations and tables as what they did for the article, I will be looking for a model, that can some how explains the median income. Additionally, I will create new variables for my model.

**Data**

The original dataset is from American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series.

**Cleaned dataset**

[Link](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv) to the cleaned csv by *FiveThirtyEight*

`all-ages.csv`


`salary_edited.csv`

My version of the data, combined from all-ages.csv and  . Added a new variable called *Engineering*, which takes value 1 if the major falls under category *Engineering*, and 0 otherwise.

`Predictive Modelling.pptx`

This file contains the results of the project, and its supported visualizations. The result was given in a presentation for MATH 215 at Denison University
