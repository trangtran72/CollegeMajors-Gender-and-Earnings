## CollegeMajors-Gender-and-Earnings

This repository contains information on the analysis about the effect of women's representation and college majors, on the average median incomes

This project was an extension to the project done by *FiveThirtyEight*.

The result of their project was published as an article *The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major* on their website in 2014.

In this project, I will be using the cleaned dataset from Five Thirty Eight. However, instead of producing visualizations and tables as what they did for the article, I will be looking for a model, that can some how explains the median income. Additionally, I will create new variables for my model.
